In the past 10+ years of my career I've worked all over the stack, from the front end all the way to DevOps and system design.

## Front-end

As a web developer, I have experience with frameworks like React and Ember to build large scale applications.
In my professional experience, I have aquired the following skills:

- I'm trained in designing interfaces that are compliant with [WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
- I'm proficient with both JavaScript and TypeScript.
- I've created D3 visualization components for data analysis.

I also have some experience with Dart and Flutter to build mobile applications for personal projects.

## Back-end

As a Java developer (and as a back-end developer in general), I've worked in enterprise and large, distributed applications for 5+ years. I the past few years, I have:

- Used frameworks like Spring, Maven, Gradle, and Play.
- Integrated with databases like PosgreSQL, MongoDB and Neo4J.
- Deployed Spring Boot and NodeJS Express based applications to Docker containers.
- Integrated Java micro-services services with cloud-hosted services like AWS RDS.

I recently wrote a book about back-end development: ["Backend Developer in 30 Days"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9355513216/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_i_V19CYDR26B3R3ST9QMPP_0).
