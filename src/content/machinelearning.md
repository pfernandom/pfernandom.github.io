I aquired my Master of Science in Computer Science title with a specialization in Machine Learning in May 2020.

In the time I worked for my degree, I gained experience with Python and tools like scikit-learn, Tensorflow and Pytorch.

I built visualization tools using Python and JavaScript's D3, sourcing from PostgreSQL databases.
