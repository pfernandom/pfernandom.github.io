As a Java developer (and as a back-end developer in general), I've worked in enterprise and large, distributed applications for 5+ years. I the past few years, I have:

- Used frameworks like Spring, Maven, Gradle, and Play.
- Integrated with databases like PosgreSQL, MongoDB and Neo4J.
- Deployed Spring Boot and NodeJS Express based applications to Docker containers.
- Integrated Java micro-services services with cloud-hosted services like AWS RDS.

I recently wrote a book about back-end development: ["Backend Developer in 30 Days"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9355513216/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_i_V19CYDR26B3R3ST9QMPP_0).
