Even though I'm a full-stack developer, front-end development has been my main role for the past years.

As a web developer, I have experience with frameworks like React and Ember to build large scale applications.
In my professional experience, I have aquired the following skills:

- I'm trained in designing interfaces that are compliant with [WCAG 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
- I'm proficient with both JavaScript and TypeScript.
- I've created D3 visualization components for data analysis.

I also have some experience with Dart and Flutter to build mobile applications for personal projects.
