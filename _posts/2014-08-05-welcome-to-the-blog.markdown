Software design and development is almost an art. Just as a musician takes a set of already existing musical notes, with properties like rhythm and and duration, 
a developer takes components, frameworks and tools and composes something new, something that makes sense for someone else. Something useful.

All we need is inspiration. That idea that help us create what is in out mind or to fix a problem that keep us awake at nights.

This blog is about those ideas. About the small problems I have, or tests I do that in some way can help anyone else to maybe not spend as much time as I do on them.
Its for you, as a reader, an for me. It will help me keep track of solutions that maybe I'll forget later and I'll need again.

But above all, it will force me to keep working on myself. I, as probably many of you, can feel lost in my personal professional development in this world full 
of distractions and temptations for your attention. It's a way to remind me that I have to keep myself curious, learning. If I don't have anything interesting to write 
here, is that I'm not filling my life with new interesting stuff. The kind of stuff that really makes you grow.


I hope this is going to be an interesting travel. For you but mostly (and maybe a little selfishly) for me.
